Radio buttons are basically used for the single selection from multiple ones, which is mostly used in GUI forms.You can mark/check only one radio button between two or more radio buttons. In this chapter, we will guide you on how to check a radio button using the JavaScript programming language.  For this, first we design a form containing radio buttons using HTML, and then we will use JavaScript programming to check the radio button. We will also check which radio button value is selected.",
