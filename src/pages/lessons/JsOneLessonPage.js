While so many have gone into extinction, the roman numerals are still in use till date.\n  The Roman system was developed about 300BC. The Romans used capital letters of the alphabet for numerals as illustrated in the table below",

        text1: `In arithmetic, there are two types of components: the numbers themselves and the  operators (also called operations) that tell you what to do with those numbers. The basic operators in arithmetic are addition (sum), subtraction (difference), multiplication (product) and division (quotient). \n So, in the sum of 7 x 3 + 5 there are three numbers; 7, 3 and 5 and two operators, a multiplication(x) and an addition (+). the order of operations used throughout mathematics, science, technology and many computer programming languages is expressed here. \n\n 1. Exponents (index) and roots\n 2. Multiplication and division\n 3. Addition and subtraction\n\n The definitive order of operations is summed up in the acronymBODMAS which stands for Brackets, Order, Divide, Multiply, Add, Subtract. it would be easier if BODMAS was recognised worldwide, but unfortunately it isn't. In the USA it is usually called PEMDAS (Parenthesis, Exponent, MUltiply, Divide, Add, Subtract). Canadians sit in the middle with BEMDAS (Brackets,Exponent, Multiply, Divide, Add, Subtract). Regardless of the exact terminology, the sequence remains the same.`,

The third and Fourth steps, division and multiplication have equal weights and so form a third level order of operations. Again the  fifth and sixthe steps, addition and subtraction carry equal weights. ",
