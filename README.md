# Guru - Virtual Learning System 

Guru is prototype virtual learning platform where it's users can learn Mathematics. It was designed specifially for secondary schools (high school) but focused on Junior secondary class 1 (JS1). This appliation uses text and images to explain topics to it's users and afterwards the user is made to undergo an assessment consisting of five questions on after learning.

The assessment is a multiple-choice single-answer question type. User proceeds to the next topic, if assessment is 80% or greater otherwise user is made to repeats the class.

## Future implementation

This application is limited to just class 1 (JS 1), it's scope can further be broadened to inlcude more topics and classes. Also the addition of video contents is also a possibility.
